# Assets Directory

Place the following files here for the README to display correctly:

## Required Assets

| File | Description | Recommended Size |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `logo.png` | Project logo | 200×200 px |
| `demo.gif` | Demo animation | 700×400 px |
| `screenshot-bode.png` | Bode plot screenshot | 800×600 px |
| `screenshot-waveform.png` | Waveform screenshot | 800×600 px |

## How to Create

### Screenshots
1. Run the web interface: `npm run dev`
2. Connect to serial port and run a sweep
3. Take screenshots of the Bode plot and waveform views
4. Crop to focus on the charts

### Demo GIF
1. Use a screen recording tool (e.g., ScreenToGif, LICEcap)
2. Record a full sweep measurement (~30 seconds compressed)
3. Save as optimized GIF (< 5MB for GitHub)

### Logo
Create a simple logo representing frequency analysis, e.g.:
- Sine wave icon
- Bode plot stylization
- Circuit symbol

## Placeholder

If you don't have assets yet, the README will still work but won't display images.
